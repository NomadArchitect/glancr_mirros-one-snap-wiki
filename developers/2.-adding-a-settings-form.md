You have run the generator and added some basic metadata for your new mirr.OS extension. Next up: Learn how to add a settings form to configure your widget or data source. Here's what we will build:

## Locating the settings template
After you have run the widget generator in the first step, open up the template file at `mirros_api/widgets/my_new_widget/app/assets/templates/settings.vue`. If you've created a source extension, simply switch go into the `mirros_api/sources/...` directory instead.

## Template structure
The default template skeleton already has some basic setup to integrate with the mirr.OS settings app. We'll assume basic Vue.js Single File Component knowledge from here on, so [read up on those first](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) if that's new territory for you. Don't hurry, we'll wait for you :wink: 

```vue
<template>
  
</template>

<script>
module.exports = {
  name: "my-new-widget",
  props: {
    currentSettings: {
      type: Object,
      required: false,
      default: function () {
        return {
          // Specify default configuration for your form controls.
        }
      }
    },
    locale: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  },
  locales: {
    // Add translations here
    /*
    deDe: {
    },
        frFr: {
    },
        esEs: {
    },
        plPl: {
    },
        koKr: {
    }

    */
  }
}
</script>
<style scoped>
  /* your styles here */
</style>
```


## Adding configuration defaults
For standard requirements, the mirr.OS settings app takes care of all the hard work for you. You just need to add some form inputs to let users configure your extension, and add the default values for those settings. Let's start with the default configuration: Open up your settings template and locate the `currentSettings` prop. This object holds the currently active configuration, and is passed by mirr.OS to your template. But when the user adds a fresh instance of your extension, you should define which fields are available and what their defaults are.

> Configuration initialization might be moved to the backend in later versions, we'll update the docs here.

For our example, we need to specify whether the checkbox „show motivational message“ should be checked or unchecked by default.

> JavaScript permits object keys with `camelCase` or `snake_case` notation. Either is fine, as long as you stay consistent and remember to check the proper casing in your display template or backend code.

We'll let our checkbox default to unchecked here:

```js
currentSettings: {
                type: Object,
                required: false,
                default: function () {
                    return {
                        showMotivation: false
                    }
                }
            },
```

## Adding the form control

The template section of your settings form starts out with an empty `fieldset` tag. Vue components require *one* root element, so just add any structure **inside** this `fieldset`.

How you structure your form is up to you, but we encourage you to use our pre-styled form controls which let you add beautiful and consistent form controls in no time. In our example, we'll use the `CheckboxBorderedLabel` component to add a pre-styled checkbox. All mirr.OS form components make use of Vue's slot concept: This way, you have complete control over your form logic while you get all the styling details to make your inputs consistent with the rest of mirr.OS' UI.

Visit the [documentation for mirr.OS form components](https://api.glancr.de/docs/form-components) to learn more.

```vue
<template>
    <fieldset>
        <CheckboxBorderedLabel text="show motivational message" for="showMotivation">
            <input type="checkbox" id="showMotivation" name="showMotivation" :checked="currentSettings.showMotivation">
        </CheckboxBorderedLabel>
    </fieldset>
</template>
```
